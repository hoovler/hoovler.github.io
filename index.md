Welcome to **{{ site.title }}**, where I provide _How-To_ posts, guides, best practice, and other substantive content related to software development and data engineering.

# The Datavangelist
### _A Periodical for Software Nerds & Data Junkies_

## About

**{{ site.title }}** is / will be a place to find random tidbits of information related to software development and data engineering concepts and practical application. The posts on this site will address a wide range of topics in these two domains, _especially_ at their intersection.  For example, content will include:

* how important documentation is to the overall success of an application  
* how to effectively use and understand list comprehensions in Python
* where to find solid data sources
* how data integrity & reliable information are critical to business operations, and how to ensure both
* anything else that a full-stack developer and data engineer might need to know
